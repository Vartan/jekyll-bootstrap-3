			<h1>Bing Bot Tool: How to use (Bookmark!)</h1>
			<ul>
				<li>
					The first input box is the number of searches you want ot make. Click <a href="http://www.bing.com/rewards/offers" target="_blank">here</a>
					to see how many you are allowed to be credited for by Bing.
					</li>
				<li>
					The second box is the interval at which bing will refresh, in milliseconds. If you are getting a dialog about redirecting, it is too slow.
					If you aren't getting the points you should be, it is too fast. Adjust accordingly.
				</li>
				<li>
					If you uncheck the checkbox in the top left corner, you will not be sent to a referral link after the bot is done.

				<p>
				<a target="_blank" href="http://naturebucks.com/members/register.php?refid=23979">Naturebucks</a> is my favorite website. The minimum payout is $0.05. The first time I went on, I quickly made $1.00. However, the best thing
				about Naturebucks is their referrals. Five levels deep, you get 20% of your referrals' rewards. That means you get 20% of your 
				referral's<sup>1</sup> referral's<sup>2</sup> referral's<sup>3</sup> referral's<sup>4</sup> referral's<sup>5</sup> points. Assuming everyone refers exactly 5 people, and each person makes 100 points in a day,
				that would be 5^5*100*.05=312,500 points = $156 a day. Of course, this isn't realistic, but I'm just pointing out how great it is
				to have five levels of referrals. <sup><a target="_blank" href="http://www.naturebucks.com">nonref :(</a></sup>

				<h1>DISABLE YOUR ADBLOCKER FOR THIS SITE!</h1>
				<li>Although I haven't had any issues, someone said they were having a problem with the 
				bot until they disabled their ad blocker. I don't truly think there is a problem, but it doesn't hurt to display my ads ;)</li>
